# Week 5 - Assignment 3.1
# 4.6 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using raw_input to compute gross pay.
#Award time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours.
#Put the logic to do the computation of time-and-a-half in a function called computepay()
# and use the function to do the computation. The function should return a value. Use 45 hours and a
# rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75).
# You should use raw_input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number.
# Do not worry about error checking the user input unless you want to - you can assume the user types numbers properly. Do not name your variable sum or use the sum() function.

inp = raw_input("Enter Hours: ")
hours = float(inp)
inp = raw_input("Enter Rate: ")
rate = float(inp)
#print rate, hours
pay = rate * hours
if hours < 40 :
    pay = rate * hours
else :
    pay = rate * 40 + (rate * 1.5 * (hours - 40) )
print pay

# OPERATOR PRESEDENCE
# parenthesis first (hours - 40) subtract the 40 first before the multiplication
# 45 - 40 = 5 * rate * 1.5
